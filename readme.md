# Video to audio converter

#### This is a simple video to audio file program using ffmpeg on python. It does a loop of every file in a directory creating a new mp3 file with the video audio and subsequentially deleting the video file.

## How to run

* Just run this command on the command line

```
python3 main.py ./mp4_files/
```
### As long as everything of the dependecies is installed it should work, but I only use it on WSL on windows so who knows.
